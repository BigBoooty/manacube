# manacube
TUTORIAL:
##STEP 1:## Right Click 'Start.bat'
**STEP 2:** Change the USERNAME and PASSWORD with ur alts, u can have up to 10 accounts logged in per IP to comlpy with manacube rules, so if running on ur home pc, 9 alts, 1 main
**STEP 3:** Save and Close 'Start.bat'
**STEP 4:** Edit 'Script.txt', and change the server location to the location your alts will be, for example if the island(s) are on SB01, change it to '/server skyblock-islands-1'. (sidenote, if you want to run multiple alts, on multiple servers, i would recommend copying this folder, and pasting it, so you have a folder for each server, otherwise your alts will not stay on the correct server).
**STEP 5:** That is really it, unless u have an alt(s) that requires logging in with Microsoft other than Mojang, you can change this in the settings, which you can edit in 'MincraftClient.config'.
